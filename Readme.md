When you use EashChair to manage your paper submission and review, this ProceedingMaker is good to work with.

1. You download all final version PDF files from EasyChair, put to ./paper directory
2. You can modify the TCSE.tex to build the proceeding. If you have used latex to write paper, I believe that is easy to you.
3. ./paperList.tex is the file to organize your sessions. I recommend you 
  1. copy paper information to the a excel file, such as agenda.xlsx 
  2. arrange the sessions in the agenda.xlsx
  3. add some texts for formating latex file in the next step
  4. copy the text from .xlsx to the paperList.tex 
4. In this demo code, I just put part of papers, and they are all fake paper, for just demo.
